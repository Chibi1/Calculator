# Calculator
Calculator I created as a little projects for my college subject for a grade.

It is a technology application that has a graphical user interface (GUI) which can interact with a screen monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The GUI allows the user to customize certain graphic elements of the application, such as selecting different "skins" for a calculator or choosing the color and type of time display for a clock.

The software application provides the core functionality of a traditional calculator, but with added features that enable users to personalize the look and feel of the interface. In addition to basic arithmetic operations, the application includes extra buttons that allow users to modify the color scheme of the calculator and switch between different types of time display, depending on their preferences.
